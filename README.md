# AST Generation and Time Noting Assignment

**Students:** bcsf22m024, bcsf22m022, bcsf22m034

**Assigned Language:** C#

## Task Description

We were assigned to generate Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for C# code and record their execution times. We decided to focus on graph-related algorithms, specifically:

1. A simple graph declaration and DFS (Depth-First Search) code
2.  A simple graph declaration and BFS (Breadth-First Search)

## Execution Times

- Parsing time for DFS code: 139ms
- Parsing time for BFS code: 134ms

## AST Files

You can view the actual ASTs in the following files:
- [DFS_AST.txt](DFS_AST.txt)
- [BFS_AST.txt](BFS_AST.txt)
